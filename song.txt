Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, Iâ€™ll rise.
